What would Decentralized version of a game like Monopoly be like if theres no central server?


We need to keep track of accounts!

We need to make sure to have a mapping of balances!

We need to ensure random number mechanism is in place for roll of the dice. Chainlink Vrf!


But First. lets think security. 
access controls!


MonopolyGame.sol


State Variable:

ERC20Token private _token;    // to participate in game you have to have "MonopolyToken"


Modifiers:

modifier onlyMember() {  ////  Access Control!!!!!!!! onlyMember can buy()
        
        require(_token.balanceOf(msg.sender) > 0, 'member has no token');
        _;
    }




Functions:
     
        function buy() public payable onlyMember
